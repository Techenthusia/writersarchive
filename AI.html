                    We, humans, come a long way from inventing wheels to the internet, our natural behavior is always to
                    impossible make into possible like sending rockets to outer space.

                    Then we have AI, like most people we know it as a tool that generates info or images by a simple
                    commands, but was AI made for these type purposes or it's creators have other intentions? Let's know
                    briefly how AI (Artificial Intelligence, as the fancy people say it) was made and why was it made?

                    <h3>The Origin</h3>
                    <p>
                        Everyone likes a good origin story whether it be a character in a movie or an invention that is
                        preparing to change the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's go back to the 1930s when digital computers were the talk of the town or should I say
                        "world".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 1931,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del"> Kurt Godel</a> encoded
                        mathematical statements and proofs as integers and showed that there are true theorems that are
                        unprovable by any consistent theorem-proving machine, computer programs which proves theorems
                        are called "theorem-proving machine". And using mathematical statements and proof Kurt was able
                        to identified limits of algorithmic theorem proving, computing, and any type of
                        computation-based AI," eventually laying the foundations for

                        In 1935, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>, an American
                        mathematician extended Godel's proof and explained that the decision problem of computer science
                        doesn't have a general solution. He later developed
                        <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LambdaCalculus.html">Lambda calculus</a>, which will
                        eventually be fundamental to the theory of computer languages and it helps in defining a set of
                        rules for how computations work. Like Alonzo and Kurt, there was another person who agreed with
                        them.

                    <h4>Turing Proof</h4>

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof">Turing Proof</a> by
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> (often called as "father of
                        modern computer science or AI") another renowned British mathematician and computer scientist
                        published a proof in 1936 which in simple words states there are certain problems that a
                        computer cannot solve even if they are very smart. There are decision problems that are
                        undecidable and no computer can say "yes" or "no" as an answer like
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">The Halting Problem</a>, which is the
                        problem of determining whether a computer program will finish running/working or will it
                        continue to run/work forever. Even though this proof might seem like demotivation but it is
                        actually a game changer, because this proof saved so much time for researchers and encouraged
                        them to focus on developing an algorithm that can achieve achievable goals rather than trying to
                        find an answer to a question that has no definite answer. In simple words again, "go around the
                        rock which is blocking your way rather than spending time in breaking it". Well, you may ask how
                        did the proof help us? It helped us understand the limitations of AI and use creative ways to
                        design an AI

                    <p>
                        Also first mathematical description of an artificial neural network was mentioned in "A Logical
                        Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity (1943)" by
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch">Warren Sturgis</a> and

                    <h4>Cybernetics (first step to AI that we know): Call me AI from now on, ok</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">Cybernetics</a> was coined around
                        1943 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Rosenblueth">Arturo Rosenblueth</a>, and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bigelow">Julian Bigelow</a>. Cybernetics is an
                        amazing process that contributed a lot to the development of AI. In simple words, if I explain
                        it is a circular feedback system where the computer's output is it's input, going in a loop
                        while the computer corrects it's mistake which also laid the foundation of AI's, ability to
                        understand information in diiferent new ways and they correct themselves through feedbacks from
                        it's own outputs. This feature of mordern AI revolves around this process called Cybernetics.

                    <h3>Game Theory: Understanding AI in a new way</h3>
                    <p>
                        Game theory has a big role in AI development. Game Theory, not the MatPat one but instead by
                        mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John Von Neumann</a> and
                        economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Morgenstern">Oskar Morgenstern</a>, was
                        introduced with the 1944 paper "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior." It is a mathematical
                        model of strategic interactions; for example, if you are playing a two-player game if enough
                        data is gathered from different interactions of the game played by you is given to the computer,
                        it can predict your next move using math and statistics. It has applications in various fields
                        like social science, economics, logic, and computer science. If you read the previous sentence,
                        you will understand that game theory's main point is to predict the next move of something. Many
                        AI tools we use revolve around this theory, like weather forecasts, AI uses years of weather
                        data to predict whether it will rain or not. Like that, only chess bots could predict your next
                        move by analyzing your previous moves and understanding your pattern.
