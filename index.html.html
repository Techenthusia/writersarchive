                    <p>
                    When people hear "phishing" they often confuse it with the word "fishing", but you are not completely wrong. Phishing uses the same principles as the activity of fishing. In fishing to get a fish we attach the bait, which could be a worm or something to the end of the hook of the fishing rod and if you do it well you will catch a fish like that only online scammers pretending to be some trusted entity and using their social engineering (a technique where a person extracts information through casual conversation with a person) skills they try to get sensitive information like password, username, bank details, OTP (One Time Password), social security number, photo of ID cards, etc which can bring you identity theft, financial loss, etc. Scammers commit phishing by sending emails, messages, and phone calls or making you click on shady links or ads (like Win 20000 by clicking on this link to sign up for your prize) sometimes you come across these ads online.

                    <br>
                    <ol>

                    <li>Don't share your personal in websites that are "not secure". This can be known by looking at the address bar of the search engine/web browser like the one in the image below. The secure website will have a padlock symbol in it's address bar.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Malware</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Malware, or malicious software is specifically designed to harm a computer if it is downloaded by a user. Malware is spread by scammers by sending infected emails to people and if the user clicks any of the links attached to the email it will make the computer download the malware and cause harm to the computer nowadays email applications like Gmail, and Outlook have the features which block suspicious emails but there are ways which scammers bypass it.
This includes:</p>

                   <ol>
                    <li>Viruses: Like its name, it's like a digital disease that affects the computer which downloads the infected file and can spread from computer to computer if virus-infected files are shared.</li>
                    <li>Worms: A self-replicating program that spreads quickly across the network. If a computer is infected with worm programs all the computers connected to the same network as the infected computer will be infected as well, it's like worm infestation but it's digital.</li>
                    <li>Trojan: Like the Trojan War, where Trojan was gifted with a wooden statue of a horse but inside were Greek soldiers who emerged at night and captured the city of Troy. Like that, Trojan malware is disguised as a harmless file but it contains dangerous programs to take over your computer and devices</li>
                    <li>Ransomware: It is a type of malware that locks your computer or files in exchange for ransom which in most cases is money. Well, that's scary.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>We say prevention is the best treatment, these are the steps to prevent this from happening to you:</p>
                    <ol>    
                    <li>Don't download anything from an email that looks suspicious. </li>
                    <li>If you are downloading software download it from a trusted source or verified website.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                     This cybercrime is different from the rest. Identity theft is when someone has your personal information, which most scammers obtain through phishing and installing malware onto your device and get the information to misuse it, for example if someone has your personal bank information they can apply for online loans by putting your information and the company will think you are applying for loan/borrowing money since it has your information entered by a scammer and the scammer will escape after getting the money and in the end bank/company will come and ask you to pay the loan which you have never taken, well this can only happen in online money borrowing app situation but it still can cause severe financial loss. Sometimes scammers/hackers use your info to impersonate you on social media to commit crimes.

                    <p>Steps to prevent it:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                    <li>Don't reveal your personal info to anyone</li>
                    <li>Keep your passwords easy to remember for you but difficult to take a guess for others</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>If any of this happens to you and you are a victim of any of the cybercrimes try to contact your local cybercell/police immediately.</p>
